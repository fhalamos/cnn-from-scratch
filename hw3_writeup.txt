Design/choose your own model structure (12 points) and optimizer (3 points).

(1) Model hyperparams:
- Filter size, Number of filters and layers. You need to make careful choices to
tradeoff the computational efficiency and accuracy (especially in this assignment).
- Pooling vs Strided Convolution
- Batch normalization

(2) New Network architecture:
- You can borrow some cool ideas from novel convnets design, such as ResNet where
the input from the previous layer is added to the output

- Note: Don't directly use the existing network design.

Describe what you did, any additional features that you implemented,
and/or any graphs that you made in the process of training and
evaluating your network.  Report final test accuracy @10 epochs in a
writeup: hw3.pdf (3 points).

DESIGN DECISION

# Optimizer

I first used a simple network architecture to find the best optimizer and its parameters. In particular, I used a network with 2 convolution layers and two FC layers, maxpooling, dropout. Relu for activation methos.

I tried 2 different optimizers, SGD and Adam. For both of them, I tried turning on and off their internal optimizing modes (nesterov and amsgrad). I also tried different learning rates: [0.05, 0.01, 0.001]. I did all the possible combination of the previous optimizers. Results were as follows:

SGD; nesterov:False; lr:0.05. Accuracy: (59.15)
SGD; nesterov:False; lr:0.01. Accuracy: (64.16)
SGD; nesterov:False; lr:0.001. Accuracy: (65.06)
SGD; nesterov:True; lr:0.05. Accuracy: (65.67)
SGD; nesterov:True; lr:0.01. Accuracy: (68.03)
SGD; nesterov:True; lr:0.001. Accuracy: (68.51)
Adam; amsgrad:False; lr:0.05. Accuracy: (68.51)
Adam; amsgrad:False; lr:0.01. Accuracy: (68.51)
Adam; amsgrad:False; lr:0.001. Accuracy: (68.51)
Adam; amsgrad:True; lr:0.05. Accuracy: (68.51)
Adam; amsgrad:True; lr:0.01. Accuracy: (68.51)
Adam; amsgrad:True; lr:0.001. Accuracy: (68.51)

We observe that, for this network architecture, the best optimizer is Adam, using amsgrad and learning rate of 0.01 (actually Adam-amsgrad got same accuracy for different lr).
